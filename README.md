# README Generator

## Description

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a terminal application that will ask the user questions and procedurally generate a quality README for a project.

- My motivation to build this application was to simplify the process of making a README for future projects.
- I built this project to save myself some time in the future for every project that I make.
- This solves the problem of wasting time doing something manually that could be taken care of faster through an automated process.
- During this project, I learned about utilizing npm packages and reading through documentation to utilize the packages properly.

## Installation

To begin to use this application, clone the repository into your computer. Once you have the repository cloned, navigate to it in a terminal and run the command `npm i`.

## Usage

To initialize the application, navigate to the directory that holds the application in a terminal. Use the command `npm run` to start the app. Follow the prompts that you are given and answer all of the questions. After you are done, you'll have a new README file inside of that same directory. If you would like to provide a screenshot, make a directory called assets and inside of that, make another directory called images. Place your screenshot in this directory titled "screenshot.png".
